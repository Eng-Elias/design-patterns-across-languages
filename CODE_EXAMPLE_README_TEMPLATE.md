# [Example Name] - [Pattern Name] Pattern

## Problem

*Briefly describe the specific real-world problem this example addresses. What challenge does the code solve?*

## Solution / Implementation

*Explain how the [Pattern Name] pattern is applied in this specific example to solve the problem. Briefly mention the key classes/components involved in each language implementation.*

*   **Python:** [Brief note on Python implementation specifics for this example]
*   **TypeScript:** [Brief note on TypeScript implementation specifics for this example]
*   **Go:** [Brief note on Go implementation specifics for this example]

## Setup

*Provide step-by-step instructions required before running the code (e.g., installing dependencies). Separate instructions by language.*

### Python

```bash
# Any setup steps for Python (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt if applicable)
# If no setup needed, state that.
```

### TypeScript

```bash
# Any setup steps for TypeScript (e.g., npm install)
cd typescript # Assuming commands are run from the example's root
npm install
```

### Go

```bash
# Any setup steps for Go (e.g., go mod tidy, ensuring correct module path)
# Mention if a parent go.mod is expected or if the example is self-contained.
cd go # Assuming commands are run from the example's root
# go mod tidy (if applicable)
```

## How to Run

*Provide clear commands to execute the main example/demonstration file for each language.*

### Python

```bash
python python/main.py # Adjust filename if needed
```

### TypeScript

```bash
ts-node typescript/main.ts # Or npm start if defined in package.json
```

### Go

```bash
go run go/main.go # Adjust filename if needed
```

## How to Test

*Provide clear commands to run the tests for each language.*

### Python

```bash
python -m unittest python/test_*.py # Adjust pattern if needed
```

### TypeScript

```bash
npm test
```

### Go

```bash
go test -v ./...
```
